# Cryptocurrencies
Module18


### Purpose of ***Module18: Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies***:
Along reading this Module, I have successfully been able to learn, notice, connect and apply the preceding Modules, which are ETL-Module 8, some of the modules related to pandas Dataframes and Supervised Learning Model-Chapter 17. 

I have learned and applied the knowledge of: 
1. Noticing the data and treating them with respect to their respective categories: Supervised and Unsupervised.
2. Performing the cleaning and filtering of the raw data Before the further treatment of the data, which in this module is Unsupervised.
3. Converting the data into "float" type as it is one of the requirement for machine language to have *numbers*. 
4. Scaling and Preprocessing of the data. 
5. Using the algorithms (K-Means, clustering, and Dendograms) to groups similar data into clusters. 
        However, in this challenge, K-means was the only algorithm that was used. It was because it speeds up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features.
6. Successfully performing the preceding steps in order to get to main goal of the *challenge*.

**Pupose of the challenge** was to create a report that includes "what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment."



Result: Successfully determined that there are three types of trading cryptocurrencies that are almost working on the same performance level regardless of the CoinName of the currency. The most active clasess are 0 and 2 and few of the coin name of the currencies are: Exosis, BlakeBitCoin, Zoin, SimpleBank, Decred, BitTokens, Internet of People, and Kek Coin. Figure 1 shows the 2D-scatter plot of the most active cryptocurrencies.

The results were obtained through 3d and 2d HVplots.
